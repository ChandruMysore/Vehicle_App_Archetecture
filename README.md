# ${1:Vehicle Tracking}
TODO: Track the vehicle geolocation based the vehicle details and with the geolocation tagged to it. and highlighting the vehicles which are not moved morethan 1meter.
## Installation
TODO: Not Required. Web Application 
## Usage
TODO: Open the Application URL in Browser and locate the Vehicle based on the vehicle Identification number.
## Technologies recommended
1. NodeJS for API services creations.
   Since we are creating Real-Time Application with Vehicles we need to dynamically calls the api services couple of times with different params. so NodeJS is more familier      with real-time apps and it is very fast and easy to handle the api calls and it provides variety of features to create so i recommend NodeJS for API creation.
2. Express framework with Node
   Since we are using Node JS we can use Express as a framework with Node and we can able to create microservices which are highly robust and very fast. and also it provides various features to handle the vehicle details and to fetch the vehicle details and to respond back the data with specific format with proper status. So that based the status we can hanlde the data and do other operations.
3. Angular as a Front End technology.
   we are creating a Single page application here so i would like to recommend Angular for web development it provides variety of features with Angular-Mat designs and able to customize the design as per the requirement. and this is a Javascript framework we can able to render a DOM without loading the entire page. and it provides able to call the api services to change the dat dynamically based on the realtime wrt vehicle details and change the vehicle position and other operations.
4. I use to prefer HTTP protocol with the service methods so that we can do a authentication and authorization check before.
5. I use to prefer Mongo DB here because there wont be much relations between the Tables we can use Mongo DB which is rich in storing a data as a JSON format Directly.
